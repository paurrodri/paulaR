\arguments{
\item{mean}{Numeric. The mean value for a single group (required when using \code{effect_size}).}

\item{effect_size}{Numeric. The effect size, either in percentage (relative to \code{mean}) or absolute terms.}

\item{is_effect_size_in_perc}{Logical. Indicates whether \code{effect_size} is in percentage (TRUE) or absolute (FALSE).}

\item{mean1}{Numeric. The mean of group 1 (required when using mean difference calculation).}

\item{mean2}{Numeric. The mean of group 2 (required when using mean difference calculation).}

\item{sd}{Numeric. The standard deviation of the data (required). This is assumed to be the same for both groups.}

\item{dropout_ratio}{Numeric. The expected proportion of participants to drop out (default is 0, no dropout).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. The significance level for the hypothesis test (default is 0.05 for a 95\% confidence level).}

\item{power}{Numeric. The desired power for the hypothesis test (default is 0.8, corresponding to 80\% power).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The required sample size per group, adjusted for dropout.

\description{
This function calculates the sample size required for a two-group comparison study
based on various input scenarios, such as mean differences or effect size (absolute or percentage).
The function automatically determines how to calculate the difference (\code{delta}) based on the
inputs provided, and it adjusts for dropout if specified.
}
\details{
The function determines how to calculate the difference (\code{delta}) based on the following conditions:
\itemize{
\item If \code{mean1} and \code{mean2} are provided, \code{delta} is calculated as \code{abs(mean1 - mean2)}.
\item If \code{mean}, \code{effect_size}, and \code{is_effect_size_in_perc} are provided:
\itemize{
\item If \code{is_effect_size_in_perc = TRUE}, \code{delta} is calculated as \code{mean * effect_size / 100}.
\item If \code{is_effect_size_in_perc = FALSE}, \code{delta} is directly equal to \code{effect_size}.
}
}

The formula used for sample size calculation per group is:
\deqn{n = \frac{2 (Z_{\alpha/2} + Z_{1-\beta})^2 \cdot SD^2}{\delta^2}}
Adjustments for dropout are applied as:
\deqn{n_{\text{adjusted}} = n / (1 - \text{dropout\_ratio})}
}
\examples{
# Using mean1 and mean2
calculate_sample_size(mean1 = 5, mean2 = 3, sd = 2, dropout_ratio = 0.1)

# Using mean and effect size in percentage
calculate_sample_size(mean = 5, effect_size = 20, sd = 2,
                      is_effect_size_in_perc = TRUE, dropout_ratio = 0.1)

# Using mean and absolute effect size
calculate_sample_size(mean = 5, effect_size = 1, sd = 2,
                      is_effect_size_in_perc = FALSE, dropout_ratio = 0.1)
